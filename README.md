## Resources:
[Java Lesson](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?si=MEXnKWuPrLpb7nl0)<br>

## Dependencies:
Dependencies should be added to the **pom.xml** file located in the src folder of this repo. 
They should be wrapped in the `<dependency>` wrapper.<br><br>
Google the dependency you're looking for with "Maven" to find the pre-wrapped lines to add to that file. As far as I understand it the dependency will e setup when your code compiles so all we have to do is add them to that file. Please ask me if you're confused about this (June)<br><br>
If you're not sure what dependencies you have installed just look at the **pom.xml** file :) I've included **PostgreSQL**, **spring web** and the **spring web tools** and setup
